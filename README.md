Complete Guide on how to create your framework.

First thing let's make sure that we can access our files with a CDN provider: I fairly advise https://raw.githack.com/ that perfectly serves our purpose here.
- Create a Repositry on Github and make it public.
- Structure your files and upload them to your Repositry.
- Copy the link of your main file and paste it in our CDN provider.
- Select the production link (there are two linksâ€¦ The other one being developement) and copy it.
- paste the element inside your head section withing a link tag in href and Voila!
